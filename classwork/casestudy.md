## Problems being faced
### What problems are facing the organization?
The data set they are working with is small and fluncuates greatly due to different interpretations of the questions and biases. This makes it harder to work with their data reliably and use it to train their model. The issue the organization is trying to fix is the billions of dollars being wasted by the US government, and the low student performance and teacher satisfaction despite the overspending. 
### What is the target variable and what type (reg or class) of solution are they developing?
This organization is working to develop the best recommender engine to reduce the billions of dollars being wasted by the U.S. Government, improve student performance, and increase teacher satisfaction. They are trying to create a regression solution.
### How would they know the solution was working (business metric)?
They can measure how well their solution is working by looking at student performance, teacher satisfaction, and long term cost savings. If these all go up, their solution is working.
### What other issues might the team be facing?
One of the main difficulties they may be facing is getting the MVP up and securing more funding and attention around their project with the unreliable data set that they have. While building their engine, it may also be hard to account for various factors between the district, as their priorities differ. Getting good feedback to analyze the recommender engine performance may also be difficult as they need a more reliable way to obtain feedback data.

## Data Concept
### How difficult is the data to gather?
Because the data is gathered by voluntary response, the data is difficult to gather and they have a small amount of it. There is a large amount of questions for the participants to answer (60 questions), which may put off some individuals who are willing to provide some feedback. However in terms of accessibility, the data they are gathering is not overly difficult to access (test scores, satisfaction ratings, etc.).
### Is the target difficult to measure or break into smaller parts?
There are different districts with varying characteristics so the target is not overly difficult to measure or break into smaller parts. Additionally, the questions answered by participants are measured on the Likert Scale (1-5) so the data is quantitative and relatively easy to measure. If they develop a structured way in a stratified manner to receive feedback through all the different categories, this would also be much easier to measure.

### What level of uncertainty (risk) are you willing to accept?
We are willing to accept around a 30% level of uncertainty, as our data sample is small. If the data set was larger, we may be able to accept up to 10% levels of uncertainty, however right now the researchers don't have that amount of data.
